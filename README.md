# Maze_Solver
Finding the shortest path of a maze using genetic algorithms
In this project, I developed a genetic algorithm to find the shortest path through a 2D maze. First I converted the maze image into a 2D
matrix and then implemented the genetic algorithm. The goal was to evolve an optimal solution over several generations.

All the steps are included in the code comments.
